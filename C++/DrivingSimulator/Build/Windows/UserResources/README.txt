UserResources folder
====================

Files placed inside the UserResources folder will be copied to the app bundle. The will overwrite files with an equal name from project or platform specific resources.
UserResource's content (except this readme file) is to be ignored when checking in to the repository. A corresponding rule has been defined in the project's .gitignore file.
